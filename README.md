## Getting Started

First, install dependencies with `pnpm install`, then run the development server with `pnpm dev`.

### Stack and Libraries Used

For this project, I used the following stack and libraries:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui as the component library
- React Hook Form and Zod for form handling and validation
- Husky, lint-staged, commitlint, Prettier, and cz-git for comprehensive code formatting and commit management. This might seem like overkill, but I love having a good developer experience and maintaining code quality. This is a pattern that I usually use in my teams.
- Zustand for state management. While a state management library might be excessive for this project's scope, Zustand's persistence middleware makes it an ideal choice for meeting the project's requirements using the middleware persist for local storage persistence.

I hope you enjoy the project! I'm looking forward to your feedback and continuing with the process!
